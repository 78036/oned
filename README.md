This project uses Python 3.

Make sure you have python 3 installed.
I use Python 3.6.
You can check by running `python3 --version` in your shell.
I recommend that you use python 3 virtual environment.
Once you install python3 venv, you can create a virtual environment.
For example, on Ubuntu or Fedora, you can run `python3 -m venv venv`.
Make sure your pip is up to date using `pip install --upgrade pip`
Then, you can install dependencies from the requirements.txt file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
